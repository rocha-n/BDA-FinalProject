# BDA-FinalProject
HES-SO Big Data Analytics project

This is a project of Big Data Analytics, teached in the context of Master HES-SO.

## Main idea and goals
We are going to use data from Kaggle, that is thausends of whines described and rated by eonologs.
We will match this data with surface radiation data, obtained from another source.

The first dataset contains region information, and our first big task will be to match this information with the surface ratiation, in order to retrieve a medium value.
The difficulty is that the first data source gives us a string with a region name, optionally a second string with a more precise geographic information, and the second data source only works by gps coordinates.

Once we will have passed this data consiliation phase, we will be able to find if there is a correlation between solar radiance and the whine appreciation.
We will also be able to potentially map a whine to a region, based on its ranking (and potentially other parameters), using machine learning.

We will see alos in witch country the pinot noir is the best for exemple
